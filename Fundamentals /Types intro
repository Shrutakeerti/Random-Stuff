In our video, we explain the fundamentals of creating artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML). The key points covered include:

AI and ML Process - This involves gathering data, 
employing ML algorithms to learn from it, 
and developing predictive models.

AWS and Pre-Trained Models - Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides pre-trained models for common tasks,
saving users the effort of creating and maintaining their own models.

Amazon Rekognition - An AWS service that uses deep learning to analyze images and videos for tasks such as facial analysis and object identification, 
it requires no ML expertise from the user.

Label Detection Demo - The video showcases how Rekognition detects and labels objects in images—such as people, 
skateboards, or trains—and gives confidence scores for each detection.

Integration with Applications - The Rekognition API facilitates integration with applications,
enabling users to send images for analysis and receive detailed information,
including the locations of objects within the images.
