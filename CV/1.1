 Deep Learning is a popular tool in computer vision because working with images can be complex. There are diverse applications, from classification, to object detection, to finding anomalies. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks with many computational layers to make predictions. Whereas traditional machine learning requires the user to provide features for training, deep learning models find features automatically.

 Designing large networks usually requires years of experience. Instead, you'll customize models created by experts and apply them to your own applications with a technique called transfer learning. At the end of the course, you'll have the opportunity to apply and practice your new skills with a final project. There are many ways to build a successful model and you'll decide which approach to take. When you're done, you'll have working code to share with colleagues and employers and the skills to tackle new image classification problem
