Fraud detection in banking.
Recommendation systems in music playlists or online shopping.
Smart thermostats adjusting temperatures.
Ride-sharing apps optimizing routes and prices.
Wearable devices monitoring health metrics.


Responsible Use and AI Ethics
As AI aims to learn like humans, attention must be paid to AI Ethics, which include:

What computers learn, and
How they learn it.
Ensuring AI is fair, unbiased, and respects human rights, equity, and privacy is crucial for societal benefit.
