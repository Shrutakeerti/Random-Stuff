In AI, the goal is to replicate human learning and decision-making processes by creating sophisticated computer programs that can:

Process vast data.
Learn patterns.
Make informed decisions.
A practical example includes streaming platforms using AI to analyze user preferences, compare them with other users,
and recommend shows or music, improving recommendations as more data (user interaction) is collected.

Defining Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves simulating human-like reasoning and cognitive processes in computers, aimed at creating systems capable of performing tasks requiring intelligence when done by humans. These tasks include:

Recognizing patterns.
Speech recognition.
Decision-making.
Making predictions.
Human intelligence works by taking in input or data, understanding and learning, then making a decision and taking action based on that decision
Human Intelligence

Human intelligence processes information, learns from it, and informs future actions based on the learned information, e.g., learning not to touch a hot stove after experiencing a burn.
