Introduction to AI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computers simulating human intelligence processes like learning, reasoning, self-correction, and creativity.

Historical Development
AI exploration began in the 1940s and 1950s, inspired by the human brain's workings. Notable contributions include:

The Turing Test, by Alan Turing, used to determine a machine's capability to exhibit intelligent behavior.
ELIZA, the first AI chatbot created in the 1960s.

The Evolution of AI

Acceleration in AI Advancements
The onset of the internet and vast data availability propelled Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, allowing machines to learn and improve from vast data sets.

In the 2010s, Deep Learning, inspired by human brain's neural networks, emerged, aiding in object and voice recognition.

AI in Everyday Life
AI's role has transitioned from mere fascination to being an integral part of daily lives, aiding in image enhancement, spam filtering, traffic management, healthcare diagnostics, and agricultural optimization, among others.

examples of **AI in Everyday Life** include traffic and energy management systems for smart cities, assisting diagnosis in healthcare, and drones that monitor crops and programming  that helps optimize yields in farming
