LLMs are behind the super popular tools fueling the ongoing generative AI revolution, including ChatGPT, Google Bard, and DALL-E.

These tools rely on a powerful technology that allows them to process data and generate accurate content in response to the question prompted by the user. This is where LLMs kick in.
They take massive corpus of text data of pretrained data tha are presented or with which we are working.

LLMs are AI systems used to model and process human language.
They are called “large” because these types of models are normally made of hundreds of millions or even billions of parameters that define the model's behavior, 
which are pre-trained using a massive corpus of text data.The underlying technology of LLMs is called transformer neural network, simply referred to as a transformer model

The underlying technology of LLMs is called transformer neural network, simply referred to as a transformer.They are capable of performing natural language processing (NLP) tasks with unprecedented accuracy and speed.
With its unique capabilities, transformers have provided a significant leap in the capabilities of LLMs. 
It’s fair to say that, without transformers, the current generative AI revolution wouldn’t be possible.
